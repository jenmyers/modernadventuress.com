<p>From 2014 to 2021, I published a newsletter called Modern Adventuress. It had links to interesting things, book/movie/music recommendations, and updates about my projects. For much of its run, it also had short essays, all of which are archived here.</p>

<p>A few of my favorite essays from the archive to start with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-handwriting.html">On handwriting</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-names.html">On names</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-doubt.html">On doubt</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-permanent-marks.html">On permanent marks</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-nostalgia.html">On nostalgia</a></li>
</ul>
