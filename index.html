<p>From 2014 to 2017, I wrote a brief essay every week in the newsletter. Beginning in 2018, those essays moved to the paid edition, but the first three years of essays are freely available to read here.</p>

<p>For easier reading, here's a few of my favorite essays from the archive:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-handwriting.html">On handwriting</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-names.html">On names</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-doubt.html">On doubt</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/on-permanent-marks.html">On permanent marks</a></li>
